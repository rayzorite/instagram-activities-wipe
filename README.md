# instagram-activities-wipe

Wipe Instagram comments/likes with Selenium automation in Python.

Instagram does not provide a "Select All" button for deleting comments and likes. Users are forced to manually select each like and comment to delete them. This script automates that process.

**Hope it helps!** Star this repo to save it for later :wink:

Disclaimer: This script is for educational purposes only. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any actions taken against your account by Instagram.

Update 05/05/24:

- You can now continue running the script after the rate limit has been reached. The script will automatically resume after it detects the rate limit has been lifted.
- Combined into one script.

Update 03/17/24:

- I have noticed Instagram imposes rate limits on the number of actions you can perform in a given time period. The script will tell you if you have hit the rate limit, and if so, you can try running the script a few hours later.
- Also, the script has been updated to use the same browser profile on every run so you don't have to log in every time (to avoid suspicion from Instagram).
